# polldaddyvoter
A votebot for polldaddy polls.

###Setup
For an embedded poll, the poll address can be found in the html (inspect element or whathaveyou).
Once on the polldaddy page, all ids are avaliable in HTML.

Set `poll_id` value equal to the pollid. This should be in the url, among other places.

Then create an array of `voteOption` objects for each thing that should be voted for.

`choices= [voteOption(option_id, name_string, times_to_vote)), ...]`

`option_id` can also be found in the page html.
The `name_string` is only for identification purposes in console output and has no effect on the functioning of the program.
`times_to_vote` can be used to setup a ratio between different voting options and will simply vote for the specific choice the specified number of times before moving to the next.
